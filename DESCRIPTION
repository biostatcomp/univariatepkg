Title: Univariate Linear Regression with Significance Testing
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Emily King
Maintainer: <eking4@ufl.edu>
Description: The univ package contains the function univariate which accepts three arguments: the dataset, outcome variable,
      and alpha level. The function proceeds to complete univariate linear regression for the remaining quantitative variables
      in the dataset. The output consists of a dataframe containing each predictor and the p-value for the univariate model
      with an astriks to indicate significance at the given alpha, the most significant predictor (smallest p-value) for the
      univariate model, and a scatterplot of the response variable by the most significant predictor (smallest p-value) 
      for the univariate linear model.
